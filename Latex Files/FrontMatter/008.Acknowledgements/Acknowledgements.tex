I feel the need to express my immense gratitude to my parents Nico and Elli Mazarakis and to my beloved brother Theofilos Mazarakis, for everything they have offered me during my student years as well for their undivided support in my every choice. At this point, I would like to thank my supervisor Mr. Theoharis Theoharis once again for trusting and devoting valuable time to get the job done.
