This master's thesis delves into the cutting-edge domain of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) with a primary focus on graphics applications. The study explores various deep learning techniques, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion Models, and Transformers. These methods have revolutionized the field by enabling the generation of realistic and high-quality content, ranging from images to entire scenes.\\

The investigation begins with an in-depth exploration of Variational Autoencoders, emphasizing their role in capturing latent representations of data. Subsequently, the research transitions to Generative Adversarial Networks, discussing their adversarial training process for generating authentic content. Additionally, the study reviews Diffusion Models, which excel in probabilistic generative modeling, and Transformers, renowned for their success in sequential data generation tasks.\\

A significant portion of the thesis is dedicated to the execution of three models in the graphics domain based on some parameters. Executing generative models through Python code or run them locally through an interface empowers users to harness advanced AI techniques. This enables the creation of diverse, high-quality content, revolutionizing applications in various domains seamlessly.\\

The findings highlight the transformative impact of these generative models on the field of graphics, showcasing their ability to create immersive and novel visual content through the amalgamation of sophisticated deep learning techniques.
