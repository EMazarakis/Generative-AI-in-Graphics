abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is attracting the increasing attention of materials community for its excellent capability of generating required contents. With the introduction of Prompt paradigm and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), GAI shifts from the task-specific to general pattern gradually, enabling to tackle multiple complicated tasks involved in resolving the structure-activity relationships. Here, we review the development status of GAI comprehensively and analyze pros and cons of various generative models in the view of methodology. The applications of task-specific generative models involving materials inverse design and data augmentation are also dissected. Taking ChatGPT as an example, we explore the potential applications of general GAI in generating multiple materials content, solving differential equation as well as querying materials FAQs. Furthermore, we summarize six challenges encountered for the use of GAI in materials science and provide the corresponding solutions. This work paves the way for providing effective and explainable materials data generation and analysis approaches to accelerate the materials research and development.}

ABSTRACT = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful technology with numerous applications in various domains. There is a need to identify the requirements and evaluation metrics for generative AI models designed for specific tasks. The purpose of the research aims to investigate the fundamental aspects of generative AI systems, including their requirements, models, input&ndash;output formats, and evaluation metrics. The study addresses key research questions and presents comprehensive insights to guide researchers, developers, and practitioners in the field. Firstly, the requirements necessary for implementing generative AI systems are examined and categorized into three distinct categories: hardware, software, and user experience. Furthermore, the study explores the different types of generative AI models described in the literature by presenting a taxonomy based on architectural characteristics, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), diffusion models, transformers, language models, normalizing flow models, and hybrid models. A comprehensive classification of input and output formats used in generative AI systems is also provided. Moreover, the research proposes a classification system based on output types and discusses commonly used evaluation metrics in generative AI. The findings contribute to advancements in the field, enabling researchers, developers, and practitioners to effectively implement and evaluate generative AI models for various applications. The significance of the research lies in understanding that generative AI system requirements are crucial for effective planning, design, and optimal performance. A taxonomy of models aids in selecting suitable options and driving advancements. Classifying input&ndash;output formats enables leveraging diverse formats for customized systems, while evaluation metrics establish standardized methods to assess model quality and performance.},
