The aim of this thesis is to focus on Generative AI algorithms, in order to list and classify the available Generative AI algorithms and applications that can be exploited in the scientific fields of Graphics.

We first provide all the necessary definitions commonly used around the AI, Generative AI, Generative AI model. 
This is the necessary background we need to be able to understand what is mentioned in this thesis. 
Then we talk about some fundamental deep learning architectures that used on generative AI models. Thereafter, we describe the implementation phases of a Generative AI models. 
Then we offer a classification of some of the advanced GAI algorithms.
The categorization of the models have been done based on the generated content, output.

In addition, in the second chapter we examine four models. We run the models, based on some parameters that we defined. #TODO
Finally, in the third and last chapter of this thesis there are the conclusions obtained from the execution of the Generative AI models for the graphics. It also mentions some important challenges around models in the field of graphics.
